This repo contains all the files necessary to run a personal, exploratory project on Time-Series Analysis and Machine Learning.

gh_timeseries_project.ipynb :
  
  Jupyter Notebook with python code implementing Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and XGBoost in exploring Time-Series hourly energy consumption (mW) data.

PJME_hourly.csv :
  
  Time-Series hourly energy consumption (mW) data from PJM Interconnection LLC, specifically from the East region of its USA-based Regional Transmission Network.

/PJME_analysis_predictions/ :
  
  Output directory for all assets produced by 'gh_timeseries_project.ipynb', directly uploaded for convenience. The python code lightly handles redundant file generation should you choose to run the repo contents locally.
